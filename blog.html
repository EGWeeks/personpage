		<h3>Week One</h3>
		<p> There is twenty of us that signed a contract to give up our normal lives. In the terms &amp; conditions they emphazied that if we came out the other side alive we would never be the same.
		<br />Day one all twenty of us were full of smiling greetings. As the days went on and the ring leaders started adding the heat and weight to each of us, I could see that some were starting to lose touch with reality. Hours on end we move our fingers a half an inch at a time. Our hands are being sculped by the Macbook gods on ever commit. My eyes move ten times faster than my hands but I sometimes wonder when they will be surpassed. I haven't played Call of Duty in over a week, wonder if all my virtual friends miss me. Tell my family I miss them and I'll see them in six months.</p>
